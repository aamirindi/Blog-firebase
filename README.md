This project is a dynamic web application built with React and powered by Firebase Authentication and Firestore. This project provides a seamless user experience starting with Google authentication, leading to a blog page featuring an intuitive navigation bar offering the ability to 'Add Blog' or 'Log Out.'

The blog page showcases user-generated content, displaying blogs with authors' names and profile pictures. For a deeper dive into a particular blog, the 'View More' button directs users to a dedicated 'Single Blog' page, presenting the full description of the selected blog post.

What sets this project apart is its robust functionality, allowing users to contribute by adding their own blogs and managing them through the power of Firestore. Users can both create and delete their blogs, exemplifying full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) capabilities within the application.
